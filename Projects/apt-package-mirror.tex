  I wrote a Ubuntu package mirror synchronization tool using Python and rsync. The tool esures that your mirror is always in a good state and never refers to missing packages. It mirrors an upstream public mirror and does not rebuild indices so it can be used to run public mirrors. It is used by The Computer Action Team to run https://mirrors.cat.pdx.edu/ubuntu .
